# path Module
The `path` module in Node.js is a core module used to work with file and directory paths in a way that is **platform-independent** (i.e., it works on both Windows and POSIX-based systems like Linux and macOS). 
It provides utilities to manipulate, resolve, normalize, and parse paths.

## Importing the module:
```js
const path = require('path');
```
