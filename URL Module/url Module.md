# url module
The `url` module in Node.js provides utilities for parsing and formatting URLs. It's particularly useful when working with HTTP servers, where you need to:
- Extract pathname, query parameters, hostname, etc.
- Construct URLs
- Modify or analyze parts of a URL

## ðŸ”¹Importing the module
It's a core module, so you donâ€™t need to install it â€” just require it.
```js
const url = require('url');
```
