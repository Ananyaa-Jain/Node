## Node.js Essentials Repository

This repository is a comprehensive guide to mastering **Node.js** and its ecosystem. It is structured into three main sections to help developers understand core concepts, build with Express, and integrate third-party modules.

### `core`
This folder covers the **fundamentals of Node.js**, including:
- **NPM**: Understanding package management.
- **Core Modules**: Hands-on examples with built-in modules like:
  - `http`
  - `fs`
  - `path`
  - `os`
  - `url`
- **Custom Node Server**: A pure Node.js server implementation without any frameworks.

### `express`
This section introduces the **Express.js framework**, focusing on:
- Basic routing
- Middleware usage
- Request and response handling
- Structuring Express applications

### `modules`
This folder demonstrates the use of **third-party Node.js modules**, such as:
