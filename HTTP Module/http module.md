# http module
The `http` module in Node.js is a core module that allows you to **create an HTTP server** and handle **HTTP requests and responses**.
## Importing the `http` Module
Since `http` is a built-in module, you can simply require it:
```js
const http = require("http");
```
This loads the module into your *Node.js* application.
